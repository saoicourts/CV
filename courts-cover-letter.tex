\noindent Apple Inc. Hiring Team \hfill May 1, 2023\\
Seattle, WA\\\vspace{0.2in}

\noindent To whom it may concern:\hfill\\

Thank you for taking the time to review my application to join the team at Apple
for the position of \textit{Machine Learning Research Scientist, Health AI}. I believe I am 
a good fit for this position not only due to my extensive technical education and experience,
but also my fondness for close collaboration and developing personal relationships. I appreciate
a working environment that is tied directly to creating tangible benefit for real people, and
I believe that the work at Apple on Health AI is a perfect way for me to realize that desire.

My primary training is as a mathematician, where I focused on a field of math called 
representation theory, a field of algebra that is interested in \textit{symmetries} and \textit{actions.}
I have always been fascinated by algebra, however I learned early on that I preferred to have
more concrete problems to help keep me focused and motivated on solving problems. 
As I worked on my primary degree, I focused on taking courses in computer and data science on the 
side to expand my skillset. I took standard courses in programming and data structures as well as 
more specialized graduate courses in data visualization and natural language processing.
During this time, I begun to understand the value of data science and computation would have in 
pushing the boundaries of society and I sensed a place I could make a difference.

Outside of coursework, I have also had several opportunities to put my skills towards solving
problems arising from different scientific areas. My first internship at PNNL had me working
on the problem of \textit{few-shot learning} in computer vision, where we developed a novel, geometry-based
method for making classifications using the latent space of a pre-trained image encoder. The second summer
focused on data generated by a new process in materials science using normalizing flows and invertible 
neural nets to attempt to tease out  Finally, at my current position, I am investigating
how our immune system responds to novel antigens using statistical models and attention networks.

I am a strong candidate because of my curiosity about new ways of reframing old problems 
to make them more amenable to mathematical analysis via all of the wonderful advancements
people have made in pure research. I believe I will thrive in an environment like Apple where
I am part of a team pushing the boundaries of AI in the pursuit of more healthy (and hopefully happy)
public.
